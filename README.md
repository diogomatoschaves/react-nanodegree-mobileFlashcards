# Readable Project - Udacity's React Nanodegree 2nd Project

This is an implementation of Udacity's React Nanodegree's Mobile Flashcards React Native project.

The app is a user interface for managing decks of particular categories, each with its own set of cards with questions
and their respective answers. The user interface allows the user to add new decks (categories), add cards to each individual
deck and to start a quiz on a respective category. When a quiz is started, each card is presented to the user with the
question, as well as a correct and incorrect button, through which the user answers the question. There is also a button
which flips the card and shows the answer. When the user chooses an answer or when the answer is shown, the user can then
proceed to the next question. When the quiz reaches its end, the user clicks a button in order to present the results.
There, the user can choose to repeat the quiz or to go back to the initial deck view.

The app's functionality was implemented using React v.16.2.0, React Native v.0.52.0, and Redux v.3.7.2.

The app has been tested for IOS platforms.
